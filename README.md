## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design (Simplified)

**Main Entities:**

- `Student`
- `Landlord`
- `Accommodation`
- `University`
- `Amenity`
- `Application`
- `Booking`
- `Status` (shared across booking & application)

**Key Relationships:**

- A `Student` can apply to or book an `Accommodation`
- A `Landlord` owns multiple `Accommodations`
- Each `Accommodation` belongs to one `University`
- Many-to-many between `Accommodation` and `Amenity`

> Schema is enforced via Fluent API in `AppDbContext.cs`.
